  summary: Transferrable, continual personalization models for interactive robot tutors
  description: Recognizing that language learning requires engaging students cognitively, affectively, and socially, 
    this project advances work to design adaptive, personalized models of students over time and across tasks.
    We apply adaptive student personalization algorithms within a suite of custom-designed games for promoting young children language and literacy skills,
    extending the scope of single-task "long-term personalization" methods to "multi-task personalized" interactions, which occur across different task contexts. 
    With continual learning methods that can model individuals over time and across tasks to improve model efficiency and student learning gains, we call 
    this combined approach "Lifelong Personalization".

- title: Affect-Aware Robots and Collaborative Storytelling

  summary: Robots that can sense and understand human emotion to build better models and interact more empathically with children.
  description: Human affective responses carry important signals for social interaction. In this series of projects, we developed
    "affect-aware" robots that sense, interpret, and incorporate affective signals into personalization algorithms for interactive storytelling.
      In partnership with local schools, we deployed these robots in classrooms and were showed that using affective signal data can improve student engagement, model inference, and student learning gains over time.
    This project also introduces guidelines and techniques for successful interpretation and use of affective data in interactive robot tutors.

  summary: Using Learning from Demonstration (LfD) to create autonomous behavior policies for social interaction tasks.
  description: "Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a popular and effective method for developing robot behaviors. Thus far, LfD has been most effective in producing physical, task-oriented behaviors (e.g. manipulation).
    We adapted the LfD paradigm to create autonomous behavior policies for social interaction tasks.
    Humans interact with a robot in two phases: during the demonstration phase, the robot is teleoperated in a Wizard-of-Oz style.
    After sufficient demonstrations are collected, they are provided as input to algorithms that learn an autonomous policy based on the demonstrations. 
    In the autonomous phase, humans interact with the robot that behaves according to the learned policy."

- title: Content Personalization and Robotic Presence in Human-Robot Tutoring Interactions

  summary: What factors allow social robots to most effectively teach students problem-solving skills?
  description: "We investigated the efficacy of three different methods of tutoring instruction: verbal instruction, video agent, and embodied robot and found that, even when delivering identical content, students who received instruction from an embodied robot learned a puzzle task significantly more quickly than students in either of the other two cases. 
    In addition, we developed a method for tracking a subject's proficiency at a complicated cognitive task composed of many unique skills via indirect observation.
    Rather than prompting a student to demonstrate his/her proficiency at each skill for evaluation, the tutor generalizes probabilistic estimates of proficiency from observed gameplay, without interrupting the learning task.
    Finally, we isolated the effect of personalized tutoring and found that even simple personalizations could produce significant learning gains during a 1hr. experiment"
