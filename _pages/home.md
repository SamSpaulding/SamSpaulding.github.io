I currently work as a Machine Learning specialist at Apple, working with the Education Services team. The contents of this site reflect the research work I did during my graduate studies at MIT and are not connected to my work at Apple. I believe that AI and Robotics are transformative technologies and have a special passion for finding creative, ethical, and impactful applications for these fields (especially in Education and Art).

I received my Ph.D. from the [Personal Robots Group](http://robotic.media.mit.edu) at the [MIT Media Lab](media.mit.edu), advised by Professor [Cynthia Breazeal](http://web.media.mit.edu/~cynthiab). My thesis was titled <a href='resources/Spaulding-phd-thesis.pdf'> Lifelong Personalization For Social Robot Learning Companions:
Interactive Student Modeling Across Tasks And Over Time</a>. This research broadly focused on designing intelligent agents that can construct models of human partners from diverse sources of multimodal data, take actions based on these models, and reason about and refine those models in educational interactions.

<!-- My work aims to advance AI and Robotics by building intelligent systems that can successfully interact with others to achieve goals in the real world. In addition to other robots and intelligent agents, real world robots are increasingly interacting closely and in-person with humans, so an important component of my research focuses on building robots that can interact flexibly and fluently with humans. -->

<!-- My thesis research has focused on designing social robots that can construct models of human interaction partners from diverse sources of multimodal data, take actions based on these models, and reason about and refine its actions and the models of the interaction partner(s). Specifically, my Ph.D. work introduces and evaluates a new class of "lifelong personalization" models that are [*transferrable*](/resources/Spaulding_AAMAS21.pdf) and [*continual*](/resources/SpauldingLifelongFrontiers21.pdf) -- that is, they personalize to partners across tasks and over time.--> 
		
From 2015-2017, I worked at [Jibo Inc.](https://www.jibo.com/) on the Robot Skills and Character AI teams, helping to develop the world's first social robot for the home. Before coming to MIT, I received a B.S. in Computer Science from Yale University. While there, I worked with Professor Brian Scassellati in the [Yale Social Robotics Lab](http://scazlab.yale.edu) and spent summers working at [Amazon.com](http://https://www.amazon.jobs/en/job_categories/software-development) and at [Disney Research](http://https://www.amazon.jobs/en/job_categories/software-development) with Senior Research Scientist Jonathan Yedidia.
